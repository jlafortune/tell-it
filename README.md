# Tell It
Tell It is an Android app for listening to the news. Traditionally news aggregrators have required your full attention in order to consume news. Tell It is different - it reads the news to you, so that you can focus on other tasks such as driving.

Anytime you start the app the freshest news articles will be loaded, with a variety of categories. Create a queue of news articles, and Tell It will read each one. Control playback with your voice, so you can leave your hands on the wheel.

Tell It is coming in 2016. Please connect if you would like to be a beta tester or contributor!
